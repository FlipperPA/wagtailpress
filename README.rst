WagtailPress
============

WagtailPress is an Django app which extends the Wagtail CMS to be similar to WordPress.

We're working towards an alpha release. Here's what we've mimiced so far from WordPress:

* Pages
* Posts
* Tagging
* Categories

Currently working on a Django management command to import from a WordPress export. Details to come.
